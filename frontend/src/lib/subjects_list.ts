        title: 'CHEMISTRY HL',
        desc: 'HL Chemistry covers many fundamental principles of the subject, such as atomic structure, chemical bonding, organic chemistry, and analytical data. Heavy in content and tends to be considered as one of the hardest higher level courses in the programme. Very useful for students hoping to go into biomedical related fields.',

    {
        title: 'BIOLOGY HL',
        desc: 'HL Biology explores the diverse aspects of living organisms, including cell biology, genetics, and ecology. Students develop an understanding of the interconnectedness of life and its relevance to human health, evolution, and environmental sustainability. Memorization and recall-learning is imperative for this course. Helpful for biomedical related fields.',

        title: 'PHYSICS HL',
        desc: 'HL Physics compels students to learn a myriad of topics concerning both classical and modern physics, including mechanics, waves, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, engineering physics, relativity, astrophysics, and quantum physics. Considered one of the hardest courses in IB, a high degree of skill in both mathematics and problem solving are required in this course. Helpful for engineering-related fields in university.',

        title: 'ENGLISH LITERATURE HL',
        desc: 'HL English emphasizes the development of language proficiency, critical thinking, and literary analysis. Students engage with a wide range of texts, including literature from different cultures, and will consider their own interpretations as well as the critical perspectives of others, to explore how such positions are shaped by cultural belief systems and to negotiate meanings for texts. Students learn to express themselves effectively through speaking, writing, and interpretation. HL English Literature students study 13 works, write an additional 1200-1500 word essay on a chosen work, and develop skills in literary criticism and cultural assessments in interpretation.',

        title: 'ECON HL (ON REQUEST)',
        desc: 'Students studying HL Economics explore economic theories and analysis in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and global economics. Students use economic theories to examine the ways in which choices are made with respect to scarcity, integrating nine key concepts in their analysis. Students are expected to keep up with current economic affairs, writing three 800-word paper analyses on real-world situations. Students will be able to appreciate both the values and limitations of economic models in explaining real-world economic behavior and outcomes. Useful for students studying economics, accounting, business or looking to gain transfer credits for university courses.',

Students study 9 works at the SL English level. Similar in assessment structure and proficiency demand as HL but lacks the additional HL Essay (1200-1500 word essay) and exam essay that HL students write.',

        title: 'ECON SL (ON REQUEST)',
        desc: "Students studying SL Economics use economic theories in relation to microeconomics, macroeconomics, and global economics to analyze real-world situations. Students integrate the nine key concepts (scarcity, choice, well-being, efficiency, change, interdependence, intervention, equity, and economic sustainability) in economic analyses to evaluate the effectiveness and fallacies of economic policies. Very similar content-wise to HL Economics.",
